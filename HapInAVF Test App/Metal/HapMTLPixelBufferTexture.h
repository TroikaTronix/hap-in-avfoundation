/*		- data storage class that handles creation of id<MTLTextures> used for hap decoding
		- intended to be cached/kept around locally per-playback-source
		- stores textures that are populated from a HapDecoderFrame instance
			- will create textures from scratch if existing textures are nil, the wrong format, or the wrong size
			- you should probably cache this object to cache the textures associated with it
			- textures are populated via 'populateWithHapDecoderFrame:inCommandBuffer:'
			- use -[MTLRenderCommandEncoder useResource:usage:stages:] to ensure that the textures are flagged for use by your encoder and that their contents will be updated when your shader executes!
